- Fix the syntax in some example's shader.
- Glam type can be used as uniforms directly.
- Add `#[uniform]` macro to layout the data as `std140`.
- On MacOS, disabled the high dpi resolution by default.
- On Web, disabled the high dpi resolution by default.
- Added `WindowConfig::high_dpi` to enable high resolution on MacOS and Web.
- Added `Draw::screen_to_world_position` and `Draw::world_to_screen_position` to convert coordinates.
- Added `DrawBuilder::screen_to_local_position` and `DrawBuilder::local_to_screen_position` to convert coordinates.
- Fix 15 Puzzle game bug.
- Change `WindowConfig` to take values instead of set the `!default` value.
- Fix `wasm32` warnings due a leaked reference.
- Add `WindoConfig::canvas_id` to use or create a custom canvas.
- Remove the deprecated `notan::math::DEG_TO_RAD` and `notan::math::RAD_TO_DEG`.
- Fix using `lazy_mode` an empty buffer after the first swap buffers.
- Add `draw_projection.rs` example.
- Add `extra` feature and `notan_extra` crate to add utils/struct that doesn't fit in other crates.
- Add `extra::FpsLimit` to limit the maximum framerate and save CPU cycles putting it to sleep.
- Removed `app::FpsPlugin` in favour of `extra::FpsLimit`.

## v0.5.1  04/07/2022

- Fixed window shader compilation. 
- Egui will call RequestRedraw when there is some animation, no need to call it manually anymore.

## v0.5.0 - 26/06/2022

- Removed chrono due to a security issue.
- Fixed viewport issues where the Y axis was inverted and wasn't using DPI to calculate min positon.
- Fixed EGUI 0.18.1. Paint callback feature.
- Added `Window::set_capture_cursor` and `Window::capture_cursor` to confine the cursor into the window's app.
- Added `app.mouse.wheel_delta` to read the delta without checking the event loop.
- Added `texture_to_file` feature to save textures as png files. Use `Texture::to_file(gfx, path)` and `RenderTexture::to_file(gfx, path)`.
- Window can be hidden or displayer now setting the visibility on `WindowConfig` and `Window::set_visible`.
- Fixed `wasm32` mouse drag event (it had a conflict with pointerevents).
- Inlined docs for re-exported crates.
- Added `debug` checks for some OpenGL actions to avoid panics without info for bad API use.
- Added example for `texture_to_file`.

* Deprecated `math::DEG_TO_RAD` and `math::RAD_TO_DEG` (rust provides `.to_radians()` and `.to_degrees()`)
* Textures need to be declared on the pipeline with the location ID `.with_texture_location(0, "uniform_id")`
* Added `15puzzle` example
